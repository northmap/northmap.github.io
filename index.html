    <b>Dear User,</b><br>
    Welcome to the Cuilcagh Lakelands UNESCO Global Geopark Digital Poetry Map.  Necessity is truly the mother of invention. But for Covid 19 this digital Poetry Map project might not have been conceived and, after a long pandemic gestation, eventually delivered on UNESCO World Poetry Day, 21st March 2022.  The Digital Poetry Map project has delivered 15 new poems from, established and emerging poets and schoolchildren from across the Geopark that are inspired by its landscape or more specifically its geoheritage. Put simply, geoheritage is a heritage category similar to natural heritage, built or cultural heritage but in this instance geology or rocks are the focus. These are places which contain locally, Nationally or Internationally rare or unique rock types or these are sites which help our understanding into the formation of the Earth and its associated processes.<br><br>

    So sit back, relax and delve into the rich geoheritage of our Geopark from the comfort of your own home!<br> 

    <br><b>Instructions</b><br>
    Use mouse scroll wheel or the navigation tool at top-right of screen to zoom in or out, or to change map orientation. Move your cursor over an icon on the map. Click it and a pop-up box will appear containing a description, voice recording, video or photo. Click to watch or listen. For best sound quality listen with headphones. Other named dots in the same locality will be highlighted should you wish to view them also. Alternatively click on a title of a poem in the left-hand side playlist menu which are arranged alphabetically. The map will zoom to the location and a pop-up box will appear. Again, click on the play icon within the box to listen to a recording or watch a video. Go through the list alphabetically if you choose. If you are inspired by the map and would like to contribute digital items of heritage interest, please <a href="mailto:info@cuilcaghlakelands.org">get in touch</a>. <br><br>
    
    
    Copyrights, credits and acknowledgements are noted within the pop-up boxes where relevant.</a>

    Cuilcagh Lakelands Geopark Poetry Map has been a collaboration of many talents and creators. It includes newly commissioned work from established writers. From the outset we wanted to include poets and writers with a solid connection to this internationally renowned landscape.  The commissioned poets include Belcoo native Maria McManus and Fermanagh based Séamas Mac Annaidh. Dara McAnulty, author of award-winning Diary of a Young Naturalist, spent his early years in Fermanagh and many Geopark sites are close to his heart. Noel Monaghan, author of seven poetry collections, lives in County Cavan and has written many poems inspired by Cavan Burren Park. Anthony J. Quinn, better known for his crime novels, was Cavan County Writer in Residence 2020-2021 and led landscape writing initiatives during his term.<br><br> 

    It was also very important to reach out to the public and an Open Call has contributed work from new and emerging poets who responded with their own Geoheritage themed poem on a specific Geopark site.  The pandemic limited contributions from school children; but, we are especially grateful to Florencecourt Primary School, Fermanagh, and Curravagh National School, Cavan, for agreeing to participate in the project.<br><br> 

    The open call for submissions included potential contributions not just from Geopark residents, or residents of the island of Ireland, but from the Irish diaspora in the USA, England, France and Singapore. All the poems submitted exhibited a profound love for the planet, as represented by this particular and unique corner of the globe. We are grateful for each and every poem submitted. Would that we had the space to include all those heartfelt connections to the natural and built heritage sites within Cuilcagh Lakelands Geopark.<br><br>

    Imagination and creative activity in its myriad forms – from wordsmith to web builder – makes our world, and this Geopark Poetry Map. We may not make megaliths, but we still have the instinct to make our mark and often it takes a cross-border village of creatives and their allies to fully realise a vision such as the Geopark Poetry Map.<br><br>

    We are grateful for the support without which the Poetry Map would not have been made manifest. Firstly, to Geological Survey Ireland Geoheritage Fund for their fnding, advice, and support. They embraced this concept powered by the often non-scientifically motivated imaginations of poets; thank you for that leap of faith. Special thanks to Martina O’Neill, then in her Geopark role as Development Officer – Partnership & Engagement for supporting the idea from the first phone call from Bee Smith; a poet and Geopark Ambassador, Bee curated the poetry part of this project when seeking an alternative for fulfilling an Artistic Development grant from Cavan Arts Office. Cavan Co. Arts Officer, Catriona O’Reilly, has also been a staunch support throughout and introduced Padraig McIntyre of Townhall Ramor, who pitched in with casting actors for the poems’ sound recordings.  A special thanks also to Bryony May, Arts Manager with Fermanagh and Omagh District  Council for her support and advice throughout this project. The Digital Poetry Map was produced by <a href="https://www.northmappingservices.com" target="_blank">North Mapping Services.</a><br><br>
