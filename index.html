    <b>Dear User,</b><br>
    Welcome to the Cuilcagh to Cleenish Memory Map. We hope you enjoy exploring the area’s rich natural, built, archaeological and cultural heritage. With over ninety places to discover it should have something of interest for everyone, including music, stories, history, old and new community-made films, natural recordings and photographs. <br>
       
    <br><b>Instructions</b><br>
        
    Use mouse scroll wheel or the navigation tool at top-right of screen to zoom in or out, or to change map orientation.<br>
    Playlist items are categorised into four heritage themes. Click on the blue “Theme” button and select your preference(s). The menu will automatically filter the items that fit with your preferred theme. <br>
    Move your cursor over a dot on the map. Click it and a pop-up box will appear containing a description, voice recording, video or photo. Click to watch or listen. For best sound quality listen with headphones. Other named dots in the same locality will be highlighted should you wish to view them also. <br>
    Alternatively click on a title of items in the left-hand side playlist menu which are arranged alphabetically. The map will zoom to the location and a pop-up box will appear. Again, click on the play icon within the box to listen to a recording or watch a video. Go through the list alphabetically if you choose. 
    <br>If you are inspired by the map and would like to contribute digital items of heritage interest, please <a href="mailto:barney@c2c.org.uk">get in touch</a>.<br>

    The C2C Memory Map could not have been made without contributions of time and resources from the following people: Brendan Leonard generously gave us access to his wonderful videos of traditional farming methods and craft making; James Bamford from <a href="https://www.northmappingservices.com" target="_blank">North Mapping Services</a> designed the map; <a href="https://andrewkhew.com" target="_blank">Andrew Khew</a> directed the C2C film for National Heritage Week 2020 and edited several of the short interview films; Angel Perez Grandi from <a href="https://www.soundarkstudios.com" target="_blank">Sound Ark Studios</a> edited films and recordings. Interviewees who shared their memories and stories with us were Eddie Brogan, Viola Wiggins, Harold Johnston, Francie Doherty, Derek Thornton, Patrick Murphy, John McNulty, Roy Cathcart, Bobby Thompson, Marion Maxwell and Myles Keogh. Young volunteers who recorded interviews were Orla Gilheaney, Orla Greene, Finn Treacy, Niall Spillane and Adam Patterson. Seamas McCanny and Angel Perez Grandi trained the young volunteers in recording and story-telling techniques. Interviewees for the C2C film and Memory Map were John Kelly, Eddie Brogan, Martina O’Neill, Gaby Burns, Paul Logue and Marion Maxwell. Participants in the Going Underground concert were Mullaghy Pipe Band, Owens Sisters, Ancient Music Ireland, Cathal McConnell, Shauneen Maguire, Tumbling Paddies, Seamas McCanny, Eugene Dolan and Tommy Owens. The biggest thanks of all is to local people within the wider Cuilcagh to Cleenish community for participating in project activities that led to many of the discoveries presented in the map, and to many a night’s craic.
