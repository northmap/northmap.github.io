    <b>Dear User,</b><br>
    Welcome to the Cuilcagh to Cleenish Memory Map. We hope you enjoy exploring the area’s rich natural, built, archaeological and cultural heritage. With over ninety places to discover it should have something of interest for everyone, including music, stories, history, old and new community-made films, natural recordings and photographs. <br>
       
    <br><b>Instructions</b><br>
        
    Use mouse scroll wheel or the navigation tool at top-right of screen to zoom in or out, or to change map orientation.<br>
    Playlist items are categorised into four heritage themes. Click on the blue “Theme” button and select your preference(s). The menu will automatically filter the items that fit with your preferred theme. <br>
    Move your cursor over a dot on the map. Click it and a pop-up box will appear containing a description, voice recording, video or photo. Click to watch or listen. For best sound quality listen with headphones. Other named dots in the same locality will be highlighted should you wish to view them also. <br>
    Alternatively click on a title of items in the left-hand side playlist menu which are arranged alphabetically. The map will zoom to the location and a pop-up box will appear. Again, click on the play icon within the box to listen to a recording or watch a video. Go through the list alphabetically if you choose. 
    <br>If you are inspired by the map and would like to contribute digital items of heritage interest, please <a href="mailto:barney@c2c.org.uk">get in touch</a>.<br>
