,,Historical & Archaeological,Annals of the Four Masters,,Lisgoole,,,Lisgoole Abbey is a large Georgian house on the shore of Upper Lough Erne with a battlement tower at one end. It has substantial grounds along the banks  of the Sillees River and was once a monastic site built in the 12th century. The abbey was burned down in 1360 and then restored and taken over by the Franciscan order in 1583. The Irish historian and scholar Mícheál Ó Cléirigh stopped there in 1631 while compiling the Book of Invasions and the Annals of the Four Masters which is an iconic history of Ireland and the most extensive compilation of the ancient annals. In the early 17th century there was a period of massive upheaval in Ireland which included the Flight of the Earls in 1607 and consequently the Irish Franciscans began to reassemble the documentary evidence of Ireland’s history from prehistory to 1616 AD. The work influenced the writing of national history from the 17th century onwards and its importance increased when the annals were edited and published in seven volumes between 1848 and 1851 by the great scholar John O’Donovan. ,,54.323866,-7.63096,,

Local Ulster chieftains led by Hugh Maguire clashed with English forces who were marching from Dublin to relieve the garrison at Enniskillen Castle. The battle was the first major engagement of what became known as the Nine Years War when Gaelic nobility opposed the extension of Elizabethan Crown authority into Ulster. This struggle was a seminal event in British and Irish history as the subsequent defeat of the Gaelic Lords led to the Flight of the Earls in 1607, and the Plantation of Ulster under King James I which has had an enduring effect to this day. The name of the battle refers to the spilling open of barrels containing hard baked biscuits which floated down the river. The biscuits were part of the provisions being brought for the garrison in Enniskillen. Paul Logue describes how the site of the battle was located. Filmed and edited by Andrew Khew.

,,Cultural,Belnaleck GAA,,,,,"When WW1 broke out Redmond urged young men to join the British Army whilst Sinn Fein called for a boycott on recruitment. Home rule was the dominant issue at the time and the Nationalist community was divided. The 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and Civil War exasperated divisions further. Ballymenone split, its band ripped apart and its instruments taken by pro-treaty members, known locally as the Molly Maguires. A group of young men decided to start a football team to bring both sides together as an act of healing. Mr Boyle in Passing The Time in Ballymenone remembers: ""The Belnaleck Art McMurroughs they're called.

,,Historical & Archaeological,Benaughlin And The White Horse ,,Benaughlin,,,"Also known as Binn Mountain, Benaughlin hill is easily recognisable in the landscape with its sharp outlines and rocky outcrops. It is steeped in legend. Donn Bin Maguire was a local chieftain who is said to have been lured to an underground lair under the hill by a white horse spirit, and he in turn carried off many people to live with him there. The image of a white horse is said to be an identifable feature on the east facing limestone cliff. White horses were also part of ancient inauguration ceremonies and the name Benaughlin is the anglizisation of ""Bin Eachlabrhra"" which means the Peak of the Speaking Horse. Binn was also known for its rich crop of wild bilberries. ""Bilberry Sunday was held on the last day of July and was mainly a young people’s day. Bilberries were usually eaten on the spot, and if the crop was good cans of them were brought down for those at home who could not go up. There was much dancing, fiddling, wrestling and fighting. The cake women and fruit sellers would come out of town the night before and there would be loads of whiskey and poteen. Crowds would come up. There would be much match making at or after it.""

,,Historical & Archaeological,"""Beyond the Arney""",,,,,"Older local people sometimes speak in a jocular way about the dangers of going ""Beyond the Arney"" as if it were a place apart and with a meaning similar to that of going ""Beyond the Pale"". The origins of this expression may have some sound historical basis as the Arney River was a natural boundary in the early Christian period between the Kingdoms of Airgialla and Brefni. Today the river is the diocesan boundary between Clogher and Kilmore whose later boundaries mirrored exactly the extent of these ancient overlordships. During the Rebellion of 1641 a decree was made by Rory Maguire to make the Arney River the front line in the uprising in Fermanagh. ""...I do hereby, straitly charge and command all manner of persons, of what rank, quality, or condition whatsoever they be, of the Irish nation, in this country, not to visit, confer, talk, or parley to, or with, any persons or persons, of, in or belonging to the garrison of Enniskillen, upon pain of death, and to forfeiting all the goods and chattels belonging to such offender or offenders, and likewise that none of the inhabitants of this country, on the west side of Lough Erne, live, dwell, or inhabit any nearer to Enniskillen, than the river of Arny, until further directions be given to the contrary, upon pain of the aforesaid forfeiture and penalty"".

Atlantic rock art, settlements, field systems, enclosures, boulder monuments and rock sculpting were identified, surveyed and recorded, and many have subsequently been added to national heritage and monument records. Like antiquarians of old, the two men adopted scientific and multi-interdisciplinary approaches to their work and the passion and dedication they give to their quest on such a landscape scale through successive time periods is truly impressive. Gaby takes up the story about how they first identified a way to interpret man-mde adaptions to large natural boulders and then how they provided evidence that they had been altered and reworked by human hands.

They put it in a farmyard shed and forgot about it. Shortly after the river was dredged and stepping stones were removed. Fifty years later Maurice was prompted to search for it again after a community archaeolgy project suggested that the site of his find may have been an ancient routeway known as the Ford of the Strangers or Robbers, then the Ford of the Biscuits and in more recent times, the Mass Pass. The sword was identified as late bronze age - nearly 3000 years old. Another recent find of a bronze age axe head suggests that the crossing point may indeed have been an ancient routeway from Connaght into Ulster. Perhaps Cú Chulainn crossed the river at this point?

Initially, the material used was waste from the local cotton industry, but later, when cotton became unavailable, backings of flax were used to make linen candlewicks. There may have been candle manufacture on the same site as at one time there were “two tanks or boilers for melting tallow”. The water used to power the factory was channelled to a large mill pond by a long mill stream which snaked its way around the hill from Tully Mill just below where todays rectory is siuated.

,25,Natural,Canoeing On The Arney River,Yes,Arney River,Various,Film,"The Arney River flows for eleven miles from Lower Lough MacNean to Upper Lough Erne. Fishing was an important activity but the water course deteriorated with the construction of the hydroelectric scheme at Ballyshannon and the lowering of the level of Lough Erne. Dredging of the River in the 1960’s had a further detrimental impact on fish stocks. However, travelling by canoe today down the slow meandering river is a wonderful way to appreciate its extensive natural heritage and beauty of the unflolding landscapes along its banks and beyond to the distant mountains. People in Glenfarne in County Leitrim often refer to their local river as the Upper Arney where it enters Upper Lough MacNean, which is apt when considered on a landscape and water catchment scale.

,34,Historical & Archaeological,Cleenish Island Monastic Site,,Cleenish Island,,,"St. Columbanus (540-615) is associated with Cleenish Island and is a major figure in early Christian European history. He founded a number of monasteries on the Continent including Bobbio in northern Italy. Indeed, many pilgrims and historians from Italy regularly visit Cleenish Island today. The island, where the young Columbanus studied under St. Sinnell, was the subject of an archaeological investigation in 2014 by a team from NUI Galway who discovered evidence of extensive occupation around the church site, and using radio carbon dating established that the skeleton of a decapitated man found at the site was killed and buried there in the sixth century. Little of the monastic site is visible above ground today as much of the cut stone was removed to build other structures in the area such as Nixon Hall. St. Columbanus continues to maintain his importance right up to the modern period, when Robert Schuman, one of the founders the modern European movement remarked in 1950 that Columbanus spoke of “a spiritual union between the principal European countries of his time.” As one of the first people to write of Europe as a united entity he is therefore sometimes referred to as the patron saint of Europe.

The side walls of the chambers were lined with upright stones and spanned with lintels and finally the monument was covered with stones to make a large rounded cairn. Visually, it would have been an impressive monument in the landscape and a statement about the importance of those buried within. As with similar monuments elsewhere the portable stone material was removed to build nearby walls and buildings and the contents of the burial chambers robbed out. ",,54.26819,-7.837196,,
,,Built and Industrial ,Community Brick Making,Yes,Arney,,,"Brick making was a seasonal industry using local clay deposits along the Arney River and turf cut from local bogs which was used as fuel to fire the kilns. In Arney these clay deposits can be found just under the thin layer of top soil, some two feet down. Once fired in clamping kilns in the fields the bricks were transported on cots down the Arney River and Upper Lough Erne to Enniskillen where they were sold to building contractors. Brickmaking was a family and communal activity that provided much needed cash supplements to these rural farming communities. This film records how local people came together in 2014/15 to relearn the forgotten craft of traditional slap brick making in the way that their ancestors had done for hundreds of years before them.

A traveller in the 1870’s mentions a brick-built house on the site but this was replaced soon after by a stone house which used dressed stones taken from the monastic site on Cleenish Island. Interestingly the house was accessible by boat from Lough Erne via a channel and Laragh Lough to the rear of the house. Marion Maxwell presents the rise and fall of this  short lived country mansion.

1,43,Built and Industrial,Tully Mill,,Florence court house,Packie Drumm,Photo with narrative,"Tully corn mill and kiln are marked on the ordnance survey map of 1834 and are of special interest because of their technical features. The mill had a rare, and indeed one of the best surviving examples in Ulster, of a mill mechanism that transfered power from the wheel to the millstones as used in European water-driven grist mills from medieval times. The water wheel operated two sets of mill stones - one for shelling and the other for grinding - and its various sieves and fans were driven off pulleys fixed to pinions. A small seed house made of Arney brick was incorporated into the corner of the ground floor. Today this listed building has been lovingly preserved and converted into a restaurant by Killesher Community Development Association.
